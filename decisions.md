# Decisions log

Decisions made outside (or after) the design spec. Newest first. Every entry
that changes architecture must name the spec section updated in the same PR;
"Spec updated: no" is only valid for process-only decisions.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line decision>
Context / Decision / Alternatives rejected / Consequence
Spec updated: <section or "no (process-only)">

## 2026-07-05 — ty replaces pyright; tiered `just check` recipes (owner directive)

**Context:** the toolchain was uv + ruff + pyright; checks were scattered
(`be-test`, `be-lint`, CI steps hand-listed).
**Decision:** ty (Astral) is the backend type checker — one vendor for
env/lint/format/types, one speed profile. Check recipes are tiered:
`just backend-check` (ruff, format, ty, fast tests), `just frontend-check`
(pnpm lint + ts checks; graceful skip until #26), `just check` (both) —
and CI runs `just check`, so the local gate and the CI gate cannot drift.
Tracked as issue #44.
**Alternatives rejected:** keeping pyright (second vendor, slower, config
duplication); change-detection inside `just check` (git-diff-driven recipe
selection is cleverness the two side-specific recipes already cover).
**Consequence:** ty is newer than pyright — if it misses real type errors
pyright catches, or false-positives block work, that is the revisit
trigger (swap back is a two-line change since the gate is one recipe).
Spec updated: §4b table, §4c tree.


## 2026-07-05 — Idiomatic-by-default with autonomous deviation logging (owner directive)

**Context:** the review checklist covered hard constraints, correctness,
contract drift, and tests, but had no idiom dimension (Python, FastAPI,
React, state management, state machines).
**Decision:** binding per-path idiom rules live in `.claude/rules/`
(`python-backend.md`, `frontend.md`); implementor and reviewer briefs and
`docs/sdlc.md` wire to them. When idiomatic is unaffordable or hurts, the
implementor deviates and logs a decisions.md entry (what, why, revisit
trigger) in the same PR — explicitly WITHOUT human sign-off; entries exist
for later revisiting, not gating.
**Alternatives rejected:** per-PR human approval of deviations (defeats the
autonomous loop); baking idiom into CLAUDE.md prose (bloats the always-on
contract; path-scoped rules load only where relevant).
**Consequence:** reviewer gains a priority-5 idiom dimension, severity by
blast radius; undocumented non-idiom is a finding, documented deviations
are judged against their own reasoning.
Spec updated: no (process-only).


## 2026-07-05 — Ops telemetry: OpenTelemetry + JSON logs from the start (owner directive)

**Context:** running agents were invisible; owner wants telemetry of every
kind available from day one, not bolted on when the demo is live.
**Decision:** OpenTelemetry initialized at every entrypoint from the start;
JSON-lines stdout is the default exporter, OTLP env-gated off;
`askrag/telemetry.py` is the single setup point; ops telemetry stays
separate from product traces.db. Tracked as issue #43.
**Alternatives rejected:** paid APM (cost cap, data leaves the box); plain
logging (no structure or trace correlation); reusing traces.db for ops
(product vs ops conflation).
**Consequence:** four pinned opentelemetry packages enter §4b pre-approved;
later issues attach spans to the documented naming convention instead of
inventing their own logging.
Spec updated: D15 (new), §4b table, §4c tree.


## 2026-07-04 — PR-loop SDLC adopted: coordinator / implementor / reviewer

**Context:** execution of the spec begins; agents need a repeatable flow.
**Decision:** one persistent implementor and one persistent reviewer agent,
coordinated by the main session; branch-per-issue PRs via `gh`; reviewer
findings judged (fix/reject) by the implementor; 3-round cap then
coordinator arbitration; coordinator is the only merger; Playwright
verification for user-visible work; dependency gate (popular + actively
maintained + advisory-clean) with entries logged here. Full protocol:
`docs/sdlc.md`; role briefs: `.claude/briefs/`.
**Alternatives rejected:** fresh implementor per task (loses accumulated
context); parallel implementors (merge conflicts + divergent conventions at
this project size).
**Consequence:** work is sequential by design; throughput trades for
context continuity. GitHub cannot record formal self-approvals, so the
reviewer's `VERDICT: GREEN` comment is the approval of record.
Spec updated: no (process-only).
